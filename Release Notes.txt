QMicroz v0.5
* miniz updated to 3.1.0
* The names of static compression functions have been merged.
  multiple comress_FOO() --> single compress(...)
* Reduced verbosity. Added the ability to enable the verbose mode for member functions.
* Added static functions 'isArchive' and 'isZipFile' to avoid the need to implement such checks in the project code.
* Added function BufFile::size for a more convenient obtaining file size.
* Reference comments have been improved.
* Added unit tests.
* Fixed static build on Windows MinGW.

QMicroz v0.4
* It is now possible to request extended information about items contained in the archive.
    For example, get the modification date or compressed/uncompressed size.
* The file extracted to the buffer (struct BufFile) now also contains its date modified.
* It is now possible to both use and dispense with the proposed custom types: BufFile, BufList, ZipContents...
    For example, extractData(index) returns a simple QByteArray with file's data, if BufFile struct is not needed.
* Several helper functions have been added to make working with the archive easier.
* Header files merged.
    (qmicroz_global.h --> qmicroz.h)
* Some functions and types have been renamed.
