QMicroz v0.6
* Redesigned architecture. Significantly simplified code base.
  The main class now has functionality for more flexible zippping at a lower level.
  File qmztools.cpp deleted. Many functions have been rewritten and combined.
* Ability to zip files and folders with an arbitrary entry name.
* Ability to extract individual items to a custom path.
* Ability to concise code using << operator.
* Static compress(paths) function now allows paths with different roots.
* ZipContents format changed to accelerate the existing entries search.
  <index, name> --> <name, index>
* Ability to set last modified date to folder entries.
* Ability to extract the selected folder with its contents.
* Extracting to the memory buffer no longer excludes folder entries.
* Reduced verbosity (again).

QMicroz v0.5
* miniz updated to 3.1.0
* The names of static compression functions have been merged.
  multiple comress_FOO() --> single compress(...)
* Reduced verbosity. Added the ability to enable the verbose mode for member functions.
* Added static functions 'isArchive' and 'isZipFile' to avoid the need to implement such checks in the project code.
* Shortcuts and symlinks are no longer excluded from the path list.
* Reference comments have been improved.
* Improved BufFile handling.
* Added unit tests.
* Fixed static build on Windows MinGW.

QMicroz v0.4
* It is now possible to request extended information about items contained in the archive.
    For example, get the modification date or compressed/uncompressed size.
* The file extracted to the buffer (struct BufFile) now also contains its date modified.
* It is now possible to both use and dispense with the proposed custom types: BufFile, BufList, ZipContents...
    For example, extractData(index) returns a simple QByteArray with file's data, if BufFile struct is not needed.
* Several helper functions have been added to make working with the archive easier.
* Header files merged.
    (qmicroz_global.h --> qmicroz.h)
* Some functions and types have been renamed.

---
QMicroz v0.3
* Added the ability to work with buffered data:
    Creating zip archives from QByteArrays.
    UnZipping into RAM buffer.
    Extracting archives located in RAM.
* Extraction of individual files has been implemented.
* Micro files are zipped without meaningless compression.

---
QMicroz v0.2
* Now files are zipped directly, without full buffering in ram.
* The modification date of files is now saved when archiving.
* Improved handling of file and folder paths.
